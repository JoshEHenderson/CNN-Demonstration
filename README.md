# CNN-Demonstration
This is a demonstration of how to code a convolutional neural network. It uses a cats and dogs dataset and a very basic model to demonstrate how to build a CNN.

This is based on a presentation given at 2AI Club at the University of South Dakota on 2/13/2023.
Convolutional Neural Network.pdf contains the slides from that presentation.
CNNDemo.py contains the code presented, a basic implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network.
